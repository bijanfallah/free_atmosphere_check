# free_atmosphere_check
It is a code to check what happens during the Kernel Averaging of the model with the values in free atmosphere
### Issue Solved:
- the problem with the half level pressure have been solved.

### Future work:
- I have to find why I have negative values at the second level for NO2?
- Arjo told it might be due to the missing values !!!
- so check the missing values
#todo: check other runs like the ones with DA
